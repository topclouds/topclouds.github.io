    <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>

    <p>
        Every september, we analyzed the top web sites to determine who the top hosting providers are. The process is fairly simple:
    <ol>
        <li>
            We download the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">top 1M website file from
            Alexa</a> and we extract the top 100K.
        </li>
        <li>
            We perform a DNS lookup of the web site listed in the file to get the IP address of the main website, then we do a reverse DNS lookup to get the owner of the IP.
        </li>
        <li>
            We "curl" the website to get the web server information.
        </li>
        <li>
            We compare the IP address with the list of known IPs for each of the cloud providers.
        </li>
        <li>
            We process and present the results.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three ways to navigate this website, thanks to <a href="http://zhenjl.github.io/angular-pages">Angular Pages</a>:

            Use the left, right, up, down arrow keys to go to the different pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the navigation control at the bottom-right corner to go to different pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Swipe left, right, up, down (or click-n-drag on a desktop browser) to go to different
            pages.
        </li>
    </ol>
